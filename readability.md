# Code Readability Rant

## Quotes

* *Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.* 
  - Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman

* *Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.* 
  - Martin Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code


## Why Do You Need To Care?

F*ck you man! If you care for your team, then you need to care about your code readability.
As a programmer, code is our main medium to communicate with our fellow programmers.
That's why it is called Programming **LANGUAGE**!


## Issues

1. Names are important!

  The names **Fuk Mi** and **Fuk Yu** are only acceptable for asians!
  *"I'm giving you a silly name because I don't care about your future!"*
  
  It will last forever. So please take a considerate amount of time to think of a
  name that will f*cking make sense!
  

2. Don't try to impress me!

  So you are trying to discombobulate and flabbergast me with your convoluted words!?
  F*CK YOU! Don't ever do that. If you think you will appear smart doing that, NO,
  that only shows that you are an incosiderate dumb egocentric douchebag who is trying hard
  to gain respect from other people.
