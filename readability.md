## Quotes

* *Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.* 
  - Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman

* *Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.* 
  - Martin Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code
