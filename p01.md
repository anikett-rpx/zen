* Never build large apps
* what is modular?
* why
* Stop coding with Rails
* Afraid of PORO?
* isolate complexity
* single responsibility
* do not use mixins
* cohesion
* clean interface
* law of demeter
* conclusion
* resources

--


* we limit ourselves with what Rails can do
* write shy codes; don't reveal to much
* write clean interfaces
* law of demeter
* contract
* cohesion
* name depending on context

--
*The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break your applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application.*

# Modular

# Module?

# Class?

# Folder?

# Model?

# Mixin?

# Loosely Coupled

# Decoupled

# Independent
--
# Why?
--
*When teams are organized with lots of overlap,
members are confused about responsibilities. Every change needs a meeting of the entire
team, because any one of them might be affected.*

## **Internal changes** should not affect others as long as the **external interfaces** are not changed.
--
# CODE
--
```
is_available = @item.status == Item::Status::ACTIVE
```
--
# after change in policy...
--
```
is_available = @item.status == Item::Status::ACTIVE && @item.owner.nil?
```
--
# Write Shy Code!
--
```
class Item < ActiveRecord::Base
  def is_available?
    self.status == Item::Status::ACTIVE &&
    self.owner.nil?
  end
end

@item.is_available?
```
--
# Shy Code

* Do not reveal too much
* Do not collaborate too much with others
* Hide Complexity
* Provide an intuitive public interface

## Rails
* Framework
* Guide
* Skeleton
* Basic Structure

# Rails is NOT the LIMIT

# PORO

## Unix Philosophy
* Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
* Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines

## Pragmatic Programmer

* Keep your code decoupled; Write shy code.
* Avoid global data.
* Avoid similar functions.

## Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.

--

## Write **simple** parts connected by clean interfaces.

* Less responsibilities
* Specific use
* Responsibility can be described without using "**and**"
* Easy to understand

--

## Write simple parts connected by clean **interfaces**.

* interface = method
* intuitive
* no surprises
* no side effects


--

## Write simple **parts** connected by clean interfaces.
