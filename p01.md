# Never Build Large Apps

--

*The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break your applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application.*

-- Justin Meyer, author JavaScript MVC [(source)](https://github.com/timoxley/best-practices#never-build-large-apps)


--

# Why?


--

*When teams are organized with lots of overlap,
members are confused about responsibilities. Every change needs a meeting of the entire
team, because any one of them might be affected.*

-- The Pragmatic Programmer, From Journeyman To Master - Chapter 2, Orthogonality


--

*A system with units that are highly dependent with each other will soon be a legacy system.*

# How?

--

## Principles of X
* Isolate complexity as much as possible.
* Provide mechanism rather than policy. In particular, place user interface policy in the clients' hands.

[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System_protocols_and_architecture#Design_principles)


--

## Unix Philosophy
* Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
* Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines

## Pragmatic Programmer

* Keep your code decoupled; Write shy code.
* Avoid global data.
* Avoid similar functions.

-- The Pragmatic Programmer, From Journeyman To Master - Chapter 2, Orthogonality

# Da Fuq?

--

## Isolate complexity as much as possible

--

## **Isolate** complexity as much as possible

* Alone
* Separated
* Detached
* Loner
* Single
* Has No Close Friends
* Has No Friends At All
* Has No Idea About The Outside World!
--

## Isolate **complexity** as much as possible

**WTF Zone**

* Shit!
* WTF
* Pray for me.
* This is madness!
* How will I code this shit?!

--

# Web App

--

## Isolate Complexity

* Model - isolate business logic / database
* View - isolate user interface
* Controller - connect isolated modules (model & view)
* Routes - isolate URL parsing/interpretation

--

# Isolate More!

--

* Presenters/Decorators - isolate data presentation logic
* Observers - isolate model callbacks

--

## As much as possible, isolate until complexity level is closer to the **Meh zone** and farther to the WTF zone.

--
## Meh Zone

* I can finish this today.
* Give me an hour.
* That's it? *(Sarcastic voice)*
* Meh.


--

## Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.

--

## Write **simple** parts connected by clean interfaces.

* Less responsibilities
* Specific use
* Responsibility can be described without using "**and**"
* Easy to understand

--

## Write simple parts connected by clean **interfaces**.

* interface = method
* intuitive
* no surprises
* no side effects


--

## Write simple **parts** connected by clean interfaces.

# Simplicity = Responsibility

## More Responsibility = Complex
