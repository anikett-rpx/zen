* Never build large apps
* what is modular?
* why
* Stop coding with Rails
* Afraid of PORO?
* isolate complexity
* single responsibility
* cohesion
* clean interface
* law of demeter
* mechanism over policy
* conclusion
* resources

*The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break your applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application.*

# Modular

--

# Module?

--

# Class?

--

# Folder?

--

# Model?

--

# Mixin?

--

# Concern?

--

# Orthogonality

--

--

## Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others.

--

## Two or more things are orthogonal if **changes** in one do not affect any of the others.

## Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one **do not affect** any of the others.

## Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the **others**.

# Loosely Coupled

--

# Decoupled

--

# Less Dependencies

--

# Why?

--

*When teams are organized with lots of overlap,
members are confused about responsibilities. Every change needs a meeting of the entire
team, because any one of them might be affected.*

-- The Pragmatic Programmer, From Journeyman To Master - Chapter 2, Orthogonality


--

*A system with units that are highly dependent with each other will soon be a legacy system.*

# How?

--

## Isolate complexity as much as possible.

([Principles of X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System_protocols_and_architecture#Design_principles))

--

## **Isolate** complexity as much as possible.

* Alone
* Separated
* Detached
* Loner
* Single
* Has No Close Friends
* Has No Friends At All
* Has No Idea About The Outside World
--

## Isolate **complexity** as much as possible.

* Shit!
* WTF
* Pray for me.
* This is madness!
* How will I code this shit?!

--

# Rails Web App

--

## Isolate Complexity

* Model - isolate business logic / database
* View - isolate user interface
* Controller - connect isolated modules (model & view)
* Routes - isolate URL parsing/interpretation

--

## As much as possible, isolate until complexity level is closer to the **Meh zone** and farther to the WTF zone.

--

## Meh Zone

* I can finish this today.
* Give me an hour.
* That's it? *(Sarcastic voice)*
* Meh.

# Stop Coding in Rails

--

# Code in Ruby

# PORO

--

## **P**lain **O**ld **R**uby **O**bject


    class MyPlainOldClass

      def initialize
        # some code here
      end


      def yeah!
        # some code here
      end

    end

## Ruby is a **Language**

## Rails is a **Framework**

--

## Unix Philosophy
* Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
* Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines

--

## Pragmatic Programmer

* Keep your code decoupled; Write shy code.
* Avoid global data.
* Avoid similar functions.

# Da Fuq?

## Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.

--

## Write **simple** parts connected by clean interfaces.

* Less responsibilities
* Specific use
* Responsibility can be described without using "**and**"
* Easy to understand

--

## Write simple parts connected by clean **interfaces**.

* interface = method
* intuitive
* no surprises
* no side effects


--

## Write simple **parts** connected by clean interfaces.

# Simplicity = Responsibility

## More Responsibility = Complex

# Write A Ruby Interpreter

# To The Meh Zone!

# Write A Parser
