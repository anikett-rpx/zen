Thoughts on software engineering.

## Quotes

- *"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."* - Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman

- *“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”* - Martin Fowler, "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"

## Principles
1. As much as possible choose readability over performance. *(increase productivity of developers not machines.)*
2. Really need that performance boost? Think twice if it's really worth it to sacrifice readability.
3. Rewrite it if you need long comments to make it readable.
4. If you can't properly name a method or a variable, then you don't understand what it is.

TODO: Organize this.
