Thoughts on software engineering.

## Quotes

## Random Principles
1. As much as possible choose readability over performance. *(increase productivity of developers not machines.)*
2. Really need that performance boost? Think twice if it's really worth it to sacrifice readability.
3. Rewrite it if you need long comments to make it readable.
4. If you can't properly name a method or a variable, then you don't understand what it is.
5. Respect other's preference of solving a problem. Not everyone thinks the same way as you.
6. If you don't know, ask away!
7. Company goal above all.
8. Do not panic. Breath, think, and consult before making any critical actions.
9. Leave work at the office.
10. Build tools to make your everyday work easier.
11. Trust your co-workers. They know their shit.

*TODO: Organize and simplify this.*
